## AboutFTG-modules-repo

This is my fork of a [HitaloSama's Repo](github.com/HitaloSama/FTG-modules-repo) repo for modules made especially for [Friendly-Telegram](https://github.com/friendly-telegram), that are optimized and working only on [Friendly-Telegram](https://github.com/friendly-telegram) userbot.

For the most part, all of the modules that are not my own will be the same as HitaloSama's, but that could change, and I will not offer any support if it dosnt work for your own use case. ALL Pull requets made here will be closed and not done. 


## Installation

1. Copy this link:
```
 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LakesideMiners/FTG-modules-repo'
```
2. Add this link to the FTG settings
3. Done, now use ".dlmod" in some chat and see the modules.
